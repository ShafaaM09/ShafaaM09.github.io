        <h1>Written response:</h1>
        <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">While completing the Python Text Adventure, I gained a better understanding of the concepts we reviewed in class and built upon my previous knowledge. This was an
        invaluable experience. The problems I encountered on the way only helped clarify the information learned in class. The first issue I had was that although I had very similar code written in javascript, it was hard to translate it all
        into python. To be specific, the "state machine" was slightly different when written in python. Due to the fact that I used buttons in my older Text Adventure, I was accustomed to 
        having those options in the if statements. In Python, we didn't use buttons so I had to adapt to the different way of thinking in order to achieve my desired goal. Another challenge was the addition 
        of "replit.clear" into my Python code. I understood why replit.clear was being used but it was a change from the functions written in Javascript. To solve this minor problem, I just made sure to write down that I had to 
        reset the state in order for the state machine to work correctly. Although the code was different to a certain 
        degree, the processes that were occuring were rather the same. I enjoyed working on this project and it allowed me to better aquaint myself with the variety of ways coding languages deliver the same actions.</h3>
