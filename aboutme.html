                        <li class ="right"><hr>In the future, I hope to first become a Software Engineer, and then later on
                        dive into the business aspect of the industry and become a project manager. My two ultimate goals
                        are to create a scalable start-up relating to the field of medicine and computer science, and or have an
                        important leadership position in a company. To achieve this goal, I have selected 
                        rigorious course work along with participating in top tier extracurriculars that relate to computer
                        science and robotics. After high school, I hope to selected to attend CalTech, UC Berkeley, MIT, or Stanford. 
                        After I get my undergraduate degree, I would receive my MBA so that I could be qualified for business positions at tech companies. My interest in this field started in middle school when I took Advanced Robotics as my elective.
                        As I become a more experienced coder, I found it fascinating how I could communicate with robots by just writing 
                        programs. Competing in Botball competitions throughout middle school and high school is something I truly enjoy because
                        it's a creative outlet for me and I enjoy working with my peers to achieve our goal of placing in the international
                        competition.</li>

                                I have always had a good work ethic and been both a team player and a leader. Being
                                a part of the school Botball/Robotics team, I have shown how I am cooperative and 
                                dependable. I value the opinions of my peers because team work, really does make the dream work.
                                Managing several time-consuming extracurriculars along with competitively swimming for two hours everyday 
                                has taught me to be an efficient student. I have also been a part of Rotary
                                Speech and Varsity Swimming since ninth grade. Throughout high school, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA and 
                                have taken a combination of 5 APs in my sophomore and freshman year. Due to Covid-19 in my freshman year, unfortunately,
                                I was not able to compete in my swim or robotics competitions, however, I look forward to them this year!

                                All these experiences have enabled me to grow as an individual and become a better version of myself. From coding and
                                building robots with my teammates in robotics to improving my public speaking skills, I have learned to be more innovative and 
                                confident. Taking computer science related courses has taught me to be more curious, never shying away from 
                                trying new ways to solving a problem. I am grateful to have these opportunities because they give me the 
                                skill sets needed for the field of study I hope to pursue.

                              I will continue to work toward my dream of achieving a Software Engineer position at a top tech company, in the near future.
                              Using my past experiences and opportunities, I will strengthen my skills in order to be a valuable member of 
                              any team. The extracurriculars I have participated in have opened my eyes in an intriguing field that I
                              would love to enter. Thank you for spending the time to view my website! I would be grateful if you could take a look
