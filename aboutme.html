                        <li class ="right"><hr>In the near future, I hope to first become a software developer, and then later on
                        dive into the business aspect of the industry and become a project manager. My two ultimate goals
                        are to create a scalable start-up relating to the field of medicine and computer science, and or have an
                        important leadership position in a company (CEO or COO). To achieve this goal, I've selected 
                        rigorious course work to push me along with participating in top tier extracurriculars that relate to computer
                        science and robotics. After high school, I hope to selected to attend CalTech, UC Berkeley, MIT, or Stanford. 
                        After my undergrad, I'd get my MBA so that I'd be qualified for business positions at tech companies like Facebook and
                        Google. My interest in this field started in middle school when I took Advanced Robotics as my elective.
                        As I began to become a more experienced coder, I found it fascinating how I could communicate with robots by just writing 
                        programs. Competing in Botball competitions throughout middle school and high school is something I truly enjoy because
                        it's a creative outlet for me and I enjoy working with my peers to achieve our shared goal of placing in the international
                        competition.</li>
