                        <li class ="right"><hr>In the future, I hope to first become a software developer, and then later on
                        dive into the business aspect of the industry and become a project manager. My two ultimate goals
                        are to create a scalable start-up relating to the field of medicine and computer science, and or have an
                        important leadership position in a company (CEO or COO). To achieve this goal, I've selected 
                        rigorious course work along with participating in top tier extracurriculars that relate to computer
                        science and robotics. After high school, I hope to selected to attend CalTech, UC Berkeley, MIT, or Stanford. 
                        After my undergrad, I'd get my MBA so that I'd be qualified for business positions at tech companies. My interest in this field started in middle school when I took Advanced Robotics as my elective.
                        As I become a more experienced coder, I found it fascinating how I could communicate with robots by just writing 
                        programs. Competing in Botball competitions throughout middle school and high school is something I truly enjoy because
                        it's a creative outlet for me and I enjoy working with my peers to achieve our shared goal of placing in the international
                        competition.</li>

                                I've always had a good work ethic and been both a team player and a leader. Being
                                a part of the school Botball/Robotics team, I've shown how I am able to be cooperative and 
                                dependable. I value the opinions of my peers because team work, truly does make the dream work.
                                Managing several time-consuming extracurriculars along with competitively swimming for two hours everyday 
                                has taught me to be an efficient student. I've also been a part of Rotary
                                Speech and Varsity Swimming since ninth grade. Throughout high school, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA and 
                                have taken a combination of 5 APs in my sophomore and freshman year. Due to Covid-19 in my freshman year, unfortunately,
                                I wasn't able to compete in my swim or robotics competitions, however, I look forward to them this year!

                                All these experiences have enabled me to grow as an individual and become a better version of myself. From coding and
                                building robots with my teammates in robotics to improving my public speaking skills, I've learned to be more innovative and 
                                confident. Taking computer science related courses has taught me to be more curious, never shying away from 
                                trying new ways to solving a problem. I'm grateful to have these opportunities because they give me the 
                                skill sets needed for the field of study I hope to pursue.

                              I will continue to work toward my dream of achieving a software engineer position at a top tech company, in the near future.
                              Using my past experiences and opportunities, I will strengthen my skills in order to be a valuable member of 
                              any team. The extracurriculars I've participated in have opened my eyes in an intriguing field that I
                              would love to enter. Thank you for spending the time to view my website! I'd love if you could take a look
