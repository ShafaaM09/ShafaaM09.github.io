            <td>My name is Shafaa Munjal and I'm a sophomore at Palm Desert High School. This is a photo of my family and
            I at Tech Trek, a STEM program for girls. I was recommended by my science teacher to attend and it was 
            a remarkable experience. I spent a week learning to create apps and interacting with professionals in computer science. I'm 
            so grateful to have that opportunity because I got to meet many like-minded students
            who shared similar passions and interests as me!</td>
            <td>I love to embrace my Indian roots and excel in dancing in the Bollywood genre along with classical
            Indian dance. The photo displayed is me, to the far left, with two of my close friends at a Diwali celebration. Diwali is a 
            Hindu festival of lights.</td>
            <td>I have been doing robotics since sixth grade. Currently, I'm on the high school robotics team. We participate in 
            regional, national, and international robotics competitions. My team and I attend GCER, global conference on educational
            robotics, annually. In the picture above, I am setting up our robot, which is a roomba that we built upon, on the game board with 
            the help of my teammate.</td>
